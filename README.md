# Getting Started with Create React App

The challenge was to build out the dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Project is available online: https://fmk1994.github.io/time_tracking_dashboard/
